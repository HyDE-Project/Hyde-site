HyDE-cli is a CLI tool for [HyDE](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots).
This repository contains scripts that, while may not be perfect, could provide a better way to manage your HyDE installation.
For example, we have a functional TUI restore tool that follows `restore_cfg.lst`, power-saving options that could be useful for laptops, and much more!

> 🚨 While HyDE-cli is stable, it is important to note that these scripts do alter and *could* potentially mess up your system configuration.
> We ask that you use this tool carefully and report any bugs you find.

2) **Advanced Installation**

- For more control over the installation process, you can use the following options:

    Hyde update
    Hyde restore Config
    ```
