## Activate Shell-completions

If shell completions are not working, you can manually source them from the terminal. You can also persist the changes by adding the snippet at the end of your `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`.

#### Bash

```sh
source Hyde.bash
```

#### Zsh

```sh
source Hyde.zsh
```

## Images are not being shown in the terminal
  Make sure your terminal supports images. If you are using a terminal emulator that does not support images, you can use a terminal emulator that does, such as `kitty`.

Find the Exec = part then add the flags
image


> ðŸ“¢ Remember, if you're looking to edit or create a .desktop file, it's a good practice to place it in ~/.local/share/applications/ to avoid modifying >system-wide files. This ensures that your changes are user-specific and do not require administrative privileges

Here is the [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_entries) on how to deal with .desktop entries.
