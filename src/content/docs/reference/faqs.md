## Activate Shell-completions

If shell completions are not working, you can manually source them from the terminal. You can also persist the changes by adding the snippet at the end of your `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`.

#### Bash

```sh
source Hyde.bash
```

#### Zsh

```sh
source Hyde.zsh
```

## Images are not being shown in the terminal
  Make sure your terminal supports images. If you are using a terminal emulator that does not support images, you can use a terminal emulator that does, such as `kitty`.
